# Discovery Spec: Stance Machine

**Probed:** 2026-02-07 18:30
**Domain:** Technical + Business (hybrid)
**Depth:** Deep

## Executive Summary

Stance Machine is a hot take opinion spinner built as an SEO content machine with premium UX. The product generates organic search traffic through pSEO pages targeting "hot takes" keywords (20K+ monthly volume), while offering an interactive spin-agree-lock-share mechanic. The core insight from this probe: the product needs a data flywheel (vote persistence + user explanations) to transform thin content pages into rich, indexable, community-powered opinion destinations. A nascent "opinion cards as collectibles" concept could become the distinctive differentiator, but isn't mature enough to bet on yet.

## Key Decisions Clarified

1. **Core identity**: SEO content machine with great UX. AdSense as the revenue floor, with the flywheel data potentially unlocking something bigger. Not purely a viral toy, not purely a social platform.

2. **Build the flywheel now**: Anonymous vote counts + optional user identity (save stance cards, see history). Neon Postgres. Don't wait for validation — the aggregate data IS what makes the content worth indexing.

3. **Content quality is critical**: The current mechanically-transformed hot takes ("X is better than Y") need AI rewriting through a Claude batch pipeline to sound like things real humans would argue about on Twitter. This isn't optional — it's the difference between generic pSEO slop and a product people actually share.

4. **Fill content gaps with Claude**: Generate 200+ original, provocative takes for thin categories (work: 51, money: 90, society: 110) using Claude. Purpose-built, not transformed from questions.

5. **pSEO and flywheel run in parallel**: Launch category/tone pages for SEO now. Build flywheel in parallel. Merge them when individual take pages (/hot-takes/[slug]) have enough data to justify creation.

6. **User explanations**: Start with clickable micro-questions (preset reasons/tags) plus optional free-text. Build AI moderation. This is Phase 2 but architecturally plan for it from the start.

7. **Brand positioning**: Premium but accessible. Editorial quality of Dieter Rams meets the approachability of a well-designed quiz. Not a BuzzFeed toy, not a stuffy publication.

## Tensions & Tradeoffs

- **Quality vs Volume**: Quality is critical for the interactive experience, but SEO needs page volume. Resolution: AI-rewrite the top 200 takes per category for the spinner, keep the broader corpus for pSEO list pages where "good enough" works.

- **Lightweight toy vs Infrastructure-heavy platform**: The current zero-backend architecture is elegant but can't support the flywheel vision. Resolution: Accept the complexity. Add Neon now. The anonymous votes table is one migration — don't overthink it.

- **Content balance**: 863 relationship takes vs 51 work takes. The QuestionMonopoly corpus skews romantic. Resolution: Claude-generated category-specific takes for thin categories. Accept that relationship/philosophy will always be the strongest categories.

- **Tarot cards / collectibles concept vs shipping**: An intriguing idea emerged about opinion cards as collectible identity tokens. But it's too nascent to build around. Resolution: Design the data model flexibly enough that takes could become "cards" later (add fields for card_name, archetype, visual_id), but don't build the card UX now.

- **Accessibility for "regular people"**: The current "Pick your hills. Die on them." framing is internet-native. Needs to be more universally inviting without losing edge. Resolution: Consider softer entry framing ("What do you really think?") while keeping the provocative takes themselves sharp.

- **Revenue model uncertainty**: AdSense floor is clear, but the ceiling is undefined. Resolution: This is fine. Build for traffic and engagement first. Revenue clarity will come from observing user behavior patterns.

## Open Questions

- **Domain**: Is stancemachine.com available? Need a custom domain for serious SEO. The .vercel.app URL won't rank.
- **Language**: Is this English-only, or could it go Finnish/multilingual later? The pSEO keywords are English but the builder is Finnish.
- **Competitor landscape**: Are there existing "hot take generators" or "opinion polling" sites ranking for these keywords? Need competitive analysis before committing to the SEO strategy.
- **OG images**: The stance card sharing loop needs auto-generated OG images (social cards) to be effective. Currently there are none. This is critical for virality.
- **Content refresh cycle**: How often should new hot takes be added? Weekly? Monthly? SEO pages need freshness signals.
- **Tarot/card concept**: Worth a dedicated design exploration session. The idea of opinion archetypes ("You're a Pragmatist on money but a Romantic on relationships") could be genuinely distinctive. But needs separate, focused thinking.
- **Mobile experience**: The 6-column grid doesn't work well on mobile (currently 2-col). The spinner UX on phone needs attention.

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
- [ ] Acquire custom domain
- [ ] Set up Neon project with vote tracking table (`take_id`, `stance`, `count`, `created_at`)
- [ ] Add anonymous vote persistence (increment on agree/disagree click)
- [ ] Display vote percentages on each take ("68% agree")
- [ ] Run Claude batch rewrite pipeline on all 1,938 takes for quality
- [ ] Generate 200+ takes per thin category (work, money, society) with Claude
- [ ] Rebalance hot-takes.json with quality-rewritten content

### Phase 2: Flywheel Data
- [ ] Add micro-explanation UI (preset reasons + optional free-text)
- [ ] Build AI moderation pipeline for user-submitted text
- [ ] Optional user accounts (save stance card, view history)
- [ ] Show top explanations on category pages
- [ ] Add vote counts to sitemap/structured data

### Phase 3: pSEO Expansion
- [ ] Launch individual hot take pages (/hot-takes/[slug]) with vote data + explanations
- [ ] Auto-generate OG images for stance cards and individual take pages
- [ ] Add internal linking between related takes
- [ ] Implement FAQPage schema on individual take pages
- [ ] Target long-tail keywords per take page

### Phase 4: Explore (If Traction)
- [ ] Opinion card visual design exploration
- [ ] Archetype/personality profile based on stance patterns
- [ ] Comparison cards (react to someone else's stance card)
- [ ] AdSense integration
- [ ] Content submission by users

## Decision Record

| Topic | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Core purpose | SEO content machine with great UX | Proven playbook from sannalaskuja, but with higher design quality and flywheel potential |
| Revenue model | AdSense floor, explore bigger ceiling | Don't optimize for revenue before traffic. Build the asset first. |
| Data persistence | Build flywheel now, don't wait | Aggregate data makes content pages thick and indexable. It's the core differentiator. |
| Backend | Neon Postgres with anonymous votes + optional identity | Minimal complexity for maximum flywheel value. One table to start. |
| Content quality | AI rewrite with Claude batch API | Mechanical transforms aren't good enough. Every take should sound tweet-worthy. |
| Content gaps | Claude-generated original takes | Can't rely on QuestionMonopoly corpus alone. Need purpose-built takes for thin categories. |
| pSEO timing | Parallel with flywheel, merge later | Category pages can launch without flywheel data. Individual take pages need it. |
| User explanations | Preset reasons + optional free-text with AI moderation | Structured input reduces moderation burden while still collecting valuable data. |
| Brand | Premium but accessible | Rams-inspired design stays. Framing may soften for broader audience. |
| Card/tarot concept | Explore later, design data model flexibly | Interesting but too nascent. Don't build UX around it yet. Keep the door open. |
